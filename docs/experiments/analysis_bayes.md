## Bayes

[How to learn to love Bayes](https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-nightmare-how-to-start-loving-bayes-1622741fa960)

### The Concepts

#### Priors


#### Expected Loss

This is how we measure the effect of different variants

#### Posterior distributions

For example, focusing just on the expected loss may lead us to call null results significant. But if we base our procedure not just on the expected loss, but also the posterior probability Pr(B>A), we can focus on cases where weâ€™re confident in a positive change.
